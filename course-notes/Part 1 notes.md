| Don't define components within components | This causes lots of problems<br><br>One of these is that React treats a component inside a component as a new component in every render, and so can't be optimised by React                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Why Immediate Function Invocation in React Event Handlers Can Break the App**
Example: `<button onClick={setCounter(counter + 1)}>`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

participant App

participant Browser

App->>Browser: Renders <button onClick={setCounter(counter + 1)}>

Note right of Browser: setCounter is immediately invoked during render, not on click

Browser->>App: Triggers state update with setCounter(counter + 1)

App->>Browser: Re-renders the component

Note right of Browser: Continuous state updates trigger infinite re-renders, crashing the app

Note over App, Browser: onClick event should pass a func reference, not invoke the function
