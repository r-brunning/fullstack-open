The Content Type header of the request tells the server that the data is in JSON format:<br>![[POST request - SPA app.png]]<br>The server needs this to know how to parse the data.<br><br>The server responds with status code 201 created and does not redirect or cary out further HTTP requests.<br>![[SPA app - new note.png]]<br><br>In the JS code, a reference to the HTML form element is created using its ID and registers an event handler for its submit event. It immediately calls method e.preventDefault() to stop default handling of form's submit, which would be to send the data to the server and cause a new GET request, which we don't want to happen.<br>Then the event handler creates a new note, pushes it to the list of notes, renders the list of notes and sends to the list of notes on the server.<br><br><br><br><br><br> |

### Summary
Web pages are fundamentally built from HTML code, which servers send to client browsers to render as a structured document known as the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM acts as an API, enabling dynamic manipulation of the web page after it has been initially rendered, typically using JavaScript callback functions. While HTML provides structure, CSS is used to style web pages. Traditionally web pages required multiple requests to the server to load different data or pages. However Single Page Applications (SPAs) allow a single HTML page to load and then dynamically update the content, removing the need for full-page reloads or redirects to different pages.
